# WorkAtlas – Explore verified local businesses across India

## 🔍 What is the problem?

Finding local businesses and companies across Indian cities is often frustrating. There's no centralized, clean, or category-wise platform to:

- Discover nearby IT companies, digital agencies, or service providers
- View verified business information with location
- Filter by city, category, or search intelligently
- Visualize location dynamically on a map

Most listings are either outdated, filled with ads, or hard to filter.

## 🛠️ How it works

### 🔗 1. **Scraper (Playwright + Node.js)**
We use a custom-built scraper that:
- Opens Google Maps in a browser (via Playwright)
- Extracts **name, category, phone, address, website**
- Dynamically parses **city name**
- Automatically fetches **latitude and longitude**
- Avoids duplicates based on company name + address or website
- Stores data in: `shared/company-basic.json`

### 🚀 2. **Backend (Laravel API)**
- Laravel handles API endpoints:
  - `/companies` (with filter support)
  - `/cities` and `/categories` (for dropdown filters)
  - `/import-companies` (for dynamic JSON import)
- Stores all data in MySQL including lat/lng

### 💻 3. **Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind)**
- Filters, company cards, and map rendering
- Responsive UI with category & city filters
- Theme toggle (light/dark)
- Real-time display from backend
